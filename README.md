# LSTM Networks: Solving the Vanishing Gradient Problem (Time-Series Forecasting)



This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial and code demonstration of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**, focusing on how their internal **Cell State** solves the **vanishing gradient problem**.



## 🎯 Tutorial Focus



-   **Technique:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks.

-   **Focus Area:** Mastering the LSTM's mechanism for retaining long-term dependencies.

-   **Demonstration:** Forecasting a **Sine Wave** time series (Sequence-to-Value Regression) using PyTorch.



## 📦 Repository Contents



-   **📘 `LSTM_Tutorial.pdf`:** The detailed PDF tutorial document.

-   **🧪 `LSTM_Sine_Forecasting.ipynb`:** The runnable Jupyter Notebook code.

-   **📝 `requirements.txt`:** List of necessary Python packages.

-   **📜 `LICENSE`:** The MIT License file.



## 🚀 Getting Started



1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Requires `torch`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and optionally `cblind`).

3.  **Run the notebook:** Open and execute `LSTM_Sine_Forecasting.ipynb` to train the model and generate the prediction figure.
